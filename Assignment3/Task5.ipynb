      "\n",
      "this description, as it was written in the same language, represented a state in which all was well. there was an island of leman in the gulf of the east, called leman, or levileah, which was surrounded by a thick wall of rocks, and a high bed of snow. the settlers had been employed for a long time for the construction of their manufactories, for the construction of houses of high quality, and for the construction of their factories by means of the machinery of the sea. the settlers had all of this done in a very short time, and did not delay in their construction at all for some year. not a single one of the settlers had ever had any idea of the character of their island. it must have been built in the year of utopia, at which time the inhabitants of that state had been extinct, and yet they had not hesitated to go forth in pursuit of their wants and the betterment of mankind.\n",
